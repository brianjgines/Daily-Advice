How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


Before starting the project, I thought and write down what I needed to do before coding it. Examine the photo the project has given me. After brainstorming some ideas, went to my HTML to put a section and div container. Inside the section container, I decided to go with 3 div containers, first two had the paragraph tags, where I can target them and put the advice in and a div container to put the divider icon. The div container that holds the dice img.
After finishing my HTML, started the styling for the app. Decided to use flex to put the containers into their place. Made use of margin to help me move the container to the middle of the page. Used the z-index for the first time to make sure the two main containers overlap. 
In Javascript, simply placed the url of the api in a const variable. then used the fetch method to grab data of the api. Target the two paragraphs containers to change the number of advice and placed the advices to its fellow place
